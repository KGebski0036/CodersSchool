This GitHub project contains my solutions to tasks and homework assignments from the Coderschool course.

In the Coderschool course, we engage in a variety of activities aimed at enhancing our skills and knowledge in software development. We participate in live online group meetings where we discuss various topics related to programming.
While the primary focus is on C++, the course covers a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including Python, databases, REST API, Docker. Moreover, emphasis is placed on developing soft skills such as project management, presentation skills, and communication, along with personal development and stress management.

Feel free to explore my solutions within this repository!
